SDCC-miniGB is a minimal library for SDCC that tries to implement barely enough functions to print text to the screen.
It should also include something comparable to `hardware.inc`.

This is more meant for tests and unconventional roms, like porting algorithms with printf-debugging without too much overhead and dependencies.
If you want to create a game, please take a look at gbdk-2020.

This is neither yet usable or finished.
